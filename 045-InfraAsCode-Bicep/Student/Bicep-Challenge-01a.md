 Challenge 2 - Leveraging Parameters, Variables and Outputs

 [< Previous Challenge](./Bicep-Challenge-01.md) - [Home](../README.md) - [Next Challenge>](./Bicep-Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction

In the last challenge you will have successfully completed the coding and deployment of a storage account using Bicep.  Great job!  However, we have used a lot of hard coded entries throughout this template.  Whilst hardcoding keeps things nice and simple it's not great pactice.  Also, it means your template is very inflexible.  Lets change that!

Redevelop your Bicep file from challenge 1 so that it takes inputs to create an Azure Storage Account using parameters, a variable, and returns an output.
   - The file must take inputs: a unique storage account name, storage account SKU and a Project and Environment Tag of "Bicep Project" and "Development" respectively.
   - A variable for your resources location
   - The output must return a storage account id
   - Deploy it using the Azure CLI or Powershell
   - Observe the deployment in the Azure Portal

## Success Criteria

1. You can deploy Bicep file using both the CLI or PowerShell
2. You can view the deployment in the Azure Portal and view the inputs & outputs
