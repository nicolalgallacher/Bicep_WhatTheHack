## Introduction

A smart cloud solution architect always has the right tools in their toolbox. 
**NOTE:** The update / installation of Azure CLI can take approx. 30mins
## Description

We will be using Bicep to deploy resources into Azure in future challenges so please ensure that you have access to an Azure Tenant and Subscription with the appropriate Access Controls to deploy with. 

In this challenge we'll be setting up all the tools we will need to complete our challenges.

- Install the recommended toolset:
- If using cloud shell, ensure you have a storage account created for cloud shell to connect to
  - An [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
  - [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - Must be at least version 2.20.x
  - OPTIONAL [PowerShell Cmdlets for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-6.4.0)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Bicep plugins for VS Code
    - [Bicep VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep)
   - [Bicep CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install) - AzureCLI version 2.20 & higher should include the Bicep CLI tools.  If you are using PowerShell, you must follow the instructions at this link to install the Bicep CLI.
   - OPTIONAL [PowerShell Cmdlets for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-6.4.0)
