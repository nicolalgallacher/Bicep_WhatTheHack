# Challenge 5 - Readable Code

[< Previous Challenge](./Bicep-Challenge-04.md) - [Home](../README.md) - [Next Challenge>](./Bicep-Challenge-06.md)

## Introduction

The goals for this challenge are to understand:
- Understand the code you have written so far
- Be aware of Bicep formatting best practices 
- Make improvements to the code's readability
## Description

This challenge acts as a checkpoint to look back on the work you have done so far. Would one of your co-workers be able to easily read what you have written if you had to share the code with them?

As with other programming languages Bicep has best practices to help standardise formatting within our Bicep files. Helping to make your code as readable as possible for other (or yourself if you come back to the file after not looking at it for a few months!)

## Success Criteria

1. Alter your Bicep File to ensure it follows the same best practices defined: [Here](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep/wiki/Contributing#bicep-file-structure)
