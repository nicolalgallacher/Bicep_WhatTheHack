# What The Hack - Hack Description Template

*The following is a quick example of what the root of this WTH should look like for a fictional hack*

# IoT Hack of the Century
## Introduction
The IoT Hack of the Century will take you on a whirlwind tour in the world of IoT and how it is being used in the modern world of mineral extraction in exotic locations like the Arctic and the wilds of South Africa.

## Learning Objectives
In this hack you will be solving the common business problem that companies in the mineral extraction industry face and how IoT solutions from Azure are brought to bare

1. Provision an IoT Hub
2. Set up an IoT Edge device
3. Bring Azure Sphere to your solution for scale and resiliency 

## Challenges
1. Challenge 0: **[Prepare your workstation for IoT development](Student/Challenge-00.md)**
   - Get yourself ready to develop your IoT solution
2. Challenge 1: **[Provision an IoT environment](Student/Challenge-01.md)**
   - Create an IoT Hub and run tests to ensure it can ingest telemetry
3. Challenge 2: **[Your First Device](Student/Challenge-02.md)**
   - Make the connection to your Edge device and see that it is properly provisioned.
4. Challenge 3: **[Connecting the World](Student/Challenge-03.md)**
   - Connect your device and make sure it can see all other devices in your team.
5. Challenge 4: **[Scalable Monitoring of Telemetry](Student/Challenge-04.md)**
   - Figure out the scale problem in the world of IoT. How do you hand trillions of data points of telemetry?
