# Automating Registration with Office 365 Tools

If you are inviting people from your own organization, we have had a good experience using Microsoft Forms and Microsoft Power Automate (formerly known as "Microsoft Flow") to automate adding attendees to an Outlook calendar invite when they register.

# Coming Soon!

This article is a work in progress. We're working hard on getting the details documented so you can automate your What The Hack registration!

## DRAFT CONTENT...

## Use MS Forms to create a registration form
- provide brief abstract about your hack
- ask experience level with technology(ies)
- ask role
- ask what would make the event a "success" for the attendee

## Use MS Power Automate to add registered attendees to a Calendar Invite for the event.

You can use Microsoft Power Automate to automatically add registered attendees to the calendar block for your event!  This is important so that registered attendees get the calendar block on their calendar as soon as they register.  This avoids them forgetting that they signed up to attend.
