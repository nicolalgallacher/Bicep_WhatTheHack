# What The Hack - Challenge Solution Template

*This is a markdown template for how a WTH Challenge Solution should be organized and formatted. There really is only one section needed: "Notes & Guidance", organize all the hints for the coach there.*

*This file should be named according to this pattern: `Solution-X.md` where X is the number of the challenge, ie: 0, 1, 2, etc*

# Challenge \#: \<Challenge Name> - Coach's Guide

[< Previous Challenge](./Solution-X-1.md) - **[Home](../readme.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./Solution-X+1.md)

## Notes & Guidance
This is the only section you need to include.

Use general non-bulleted text for the beginning of a solution area for this challenge
- Then move into bullets
    - And sub-bullets and even
        - sub-sub-bullets

Break things apart with more than one bullet list
- Like this 
- One
- Right
- Here
